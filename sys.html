            <h3>Hardware & Software</h3>
            <p>
                My daily driver is a <b>Lenovo ThinkPad X230T running Debian</b>. Despite being 12 years old now, it is the machine that got me all the way through university,
                and I'm continuing to use it now. Realistically, though I am impressed with Apple's ARM chipsets of late, I think for the average Joe just about any
                computer from a decade ago to date should be able to handle most basic tasks. I'm not a gamer or a video-ologist, so this suits my needs just fine.
            </p>
            <p>
                My phone is a <b>Sony Xperia 10 IV running SailfishOS</b>. For the time being, it appears to work on VoLTE in Australia, though given 
                <a href="https://medium.com/@jamesdwho/australias-3g-shutdown-telcos-to-block-working-4g-5g-phones-2bf41e95de8a">recent events</a>, it
                may stop any day now. Sailfish is interesting, though I'd much prefer if it were fully OSS. That said, it's fun to tinker with, I believe it's safer
                (from a privacy point of view) than the duopoly of alternatives, and it's stable enough for use as a daily driver, so I'm sticking with it for now.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also run a number of Linux servers - a <b>Lenovo ThinkCentre M90n-1</b> webserver for Nextcloud and Plex, a <b>Lenovo ThinkCentre 
                M710q</b> mailserver running Postfix and Dovecot (largely as per Sam Hobbs' <a href="https://samhobbs.co.uk/2014/03/raspberry-pi-email-server">
                excellent guide</a>), and a <b>Raspberry Pi 3B</b> pi-hole & unbound server.
            </p>
            <p>
                Where-ever possible, I try to use privacy focused (to a reasonable extent, I am not a conspiracy theorist) and OSS/FOSS/FLOSS software over commercial,
                closed alternatives. This is primarily because I prefer the philosophy of it. If something doesn't work in OSS, you can usually just check the logs and
                fix it yourself. Chances are there are other people with the same issue that will thank you very much and be on their merry way. <br>
                With closed-source, proprietary solutions, you typically get an error message along the lines of "Something went wrong". The reccomended solution is to 
                try to re-install the software, operating system, maybe move house, try in a different country...<br>

            <h3>Development</h3>
            <p>
                Most of my serious development work is either no longer in use, highly specialised for a specific use-case, or was a website that is not relevant here
                and has since been handed off to someone else to maintain. These days I just make little utilities for personal use, or games and toys when I get some 
                free time. For example:
