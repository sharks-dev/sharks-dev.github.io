                    Pictured (well, drawn) is my Old Man's Leyland Moke, which is all but my daily drive, and serious fun. I caught the 'car' bug while restoring it 
                    during (but not due to the events of) 2020, though that said I was always an admirer of classic vehicles.

                My dream garage consists of this Moke, a Mini to go with it for when it's really cold or really wet, and a T-top Subaru Brumby ute (most likely with 
                an EJ donk) for when I need a little more carrying or towing capacity than the Moke can (safely) manage.

                What I don't like are ludicrously big cars - especially big "pickup trucks" (why do people call them 'utes'?). One of my favourite statistics is that
                the Datsun 1000 ute weighed 615kg and had a carrying capacity of 605kg, yet the modern Ford F-150 weighs 2535kg and has a carrying capacity of only
                685kg. Remember, that's without including the weight of the driver! It does make you wonder what the point is. A lot of waste for an extra 85kgs...

                My favourite cars are from European and Japanese marques from the late 60s through to early 80s. Think the aformentioned Datsun utes, MK1 Golf GTI, the
                original Mini, etc. 
                These cars are (relatively) easy to work on yourself, and small and light enough that their lack of power (or a fifth gear) doesn't really matter. 
                Besides, what small engines lack in power they make up for in RPM!
